    Shaves :class:`Role`\s from all members with the role, unless explicitly
    added to except_members.

    You must have the :attr:`~Permissions.manage_roles` permission to
    use this.

    Parameters
    -----------
    \*except_members: :class:`abc.Snowflake`
        An argument list of :class:`abc.Snowflake` representing a :class:`Member`
        to not shave the role from.
    reason: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The reason for removing these roles. Shows up on the audit log.
    atomic: :class:`bool`
        Whether to atomically remove roles. This will ensure that multiple
        operations will always be applied regardless of the current
        state of the cache.

    Raises
    -------
    Forbidden
        You do not have permissions to remove these roles.
    HTTPException
        Removing the roles failed.
